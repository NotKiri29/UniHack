# UniHack

For our 2023 UniHack project we decided to create QuBitTraing in which new and experienced programmers will be able to hone their skills and practice with unique and dynamically generated exercises made with AI

We made an attempt to create an api based website in which the host api in collaboration with an external generative text api will dynamically generate programming exercises in which students, self taught coders or any programmer in general no matter their experience level would have had the ability to choose their difficulty and the programming language of their liking. The api would then receive the text from the textbox and analyze the code revising the results and then providing the user with the prompts 'correct answer/incorrect answer' (bootleg compiler). Due to our inexperience in the field of apis and our time constraints in which we had to actively teach ourselves about them as well as complete our project, sadly we hit a wall from which we couldnt come out of. As a result the application is incomplete. Nevertheless we gained invaluable experience and we thank UniHack 2023 for giving us the opportunity not only to participate but also get invaluable knowledge which we will keep honing after the end of this fantastic experience.
